# Create IAM Credentials and Log into the Database

## Introduction

Now that you have enabled IAM as the identity provider of your ADB, in this lab you will
create IAM credentails for users and use those connections to connect to the database and interact with it.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 15 minutes

### Objectives
- Create IAM credentials for users of your ADB
- Use IAM credentials to log into and query the database
- Use a IAM Token to connect to and query the database

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- Completed Lab 1 & Lab 2

## Task 1: Connect to the database as Debra.

1. Create IAM credentials for user Debra. You should see something that looks like a JSON file that has no errors in it.

    ```
    oci iam user create-db-credential --user-id $DBA_DEBRA_OCID --password Oracle123+Oracle123+ --description "DB password for Debra"
    ```

2. Connect to database with IAM credentials as Debra. (Note: origionally was "sqlplus /nolog <<EOF", but that was not working for some reason)

    ```
    sql /nolog <<EOF

    connect dba_debra/Oracle123+Oracle123+@lltest_high

    select * from session_roles order by 1;
    select sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_USER') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','AUTHENTICATED_IDENTITY') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','ENTERPRISE_IDENTITY') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','AUTHENTICATION_METHOD') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','IDENTIFICATION_TYPE') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','network_protocol') from dual;
    EOF
    ```

## Task 2: Connect to the database as your OCI user & with a token.

3. Create IAM credentials for your OCI user

    ```
    oci iam user create-db-credential --user-id $OCI_CS_USER_OCID --password Oracle123+Oracle123+ --description "DB password for your OCI account"
    ```

4. Connect to database with IAM credentials as your OCI user. (needs adjustment)

    ```
    sql /nolog <<EOF
    connect "${OCI_USER_NAME}"/Oracle123+Oracle123+@lltest_high
    select * from session_roles order by 1;
    select sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_USER') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','AUTHENTICATED_IDENTITY') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','ENTERPRISE_IDENTITY') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','AUTHENTICATION_METHOD') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','IDENTIFICATION_TYPE') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','network_protocol') from dual;
    EOF
    ```

5. Finally, try connecting to the database with a token. (need better explanation here)

    ```
    oci iam db-token get

    sql /@lltest_high <<EOF
    select * from session_roles order by 1;
    select sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_USER') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','AUTHENTICATED_IDENTITY') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','ENTERPRISE_IDENTITY') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','AUTHENTICATION_METHOD') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','IDENTIFICATION_TYPE') from dual;
    select sys_context('USERENV','network_protocol') from dual;
    EOF
    ```
