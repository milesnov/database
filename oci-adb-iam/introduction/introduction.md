## Introduction

### Why use Identity and Access Management with Autonomous Database

Managing users on a database-by-database basis is cumbersome, especially when working with a large number of databases. It can lead to mistakes where database user accounts exist long after the user has left the organization. Integrating database users with Oracle Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a quick and easy way to simplify user management across multiple ADBs and improve security.
